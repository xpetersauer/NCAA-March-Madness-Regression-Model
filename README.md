# NCAA March Madness ML Model
This model was the primary model I used for the 2022 March Madness prediction. This code was intended primarily for my own use, and as such, is quite messy. Future work consists of implementing this model in a more clear-cut way so that other users can use this code and understand it

# Acknowledgements
The primary reason for this code being messy is that I incorporated several sources of information in a short amount of time. Primarily, I used the following sources for inspiration. While I cannot find the original source, there are plenty of "starter models" on the 2022 Kaggle Competition website to accredit to this model. For more knowledge on these models, [you can look at all of them here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mens-march-mania-2022/code)
